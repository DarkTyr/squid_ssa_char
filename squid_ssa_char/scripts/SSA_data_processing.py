# Purpose: SSA data processing script. Takes the screening data, calculates needed 
# values, creates plots and puts them into external documents. One document to go
# out as a deliverable, one for internal use with more specific requested plots

#Thoughts:
    #create two outputs - one that has some plots for external use, one with all plots for internal use
    #include xl table in the output doc - all one thing?
        #con with this is xl is all 8 chips ususlly - could do just one table line? 
            #could also stick with the printout xl we put together for each module on top of this so its in 
            #multiple places
    #how do plots? could create a function that takes x,y then returns a line plot then add things to 
    # each plot made by the call?
        #not sure how that would work in practice - probably wont reduce code length the way I think
    #How do we want to order the plots?
    #Do we want to always create both documents or make them both optional? Kinda like a flag thing
