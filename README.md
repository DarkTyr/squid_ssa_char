SQUID Series Array Screening Characterization Module

## Installation

One can use pip to install the package. Adding "-e" makes it a link to the source files rather than copying them to the installation directory. This allows them to be edited easily and/or updates from git happen immediately.

Run below line in terminal at the folder level with setup.py

```
pip install -e .
```
